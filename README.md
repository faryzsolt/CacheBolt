## Usage

Once installed, you can start CacheBolt with the following command:

```bash
cachebolt --config /path/to/config.toml
```

### Basic Command-Line Options

- `--config`: Specify the path to the configuration file.
- `--port`: Set the port on which CacheBolt will listen (default is 8080).
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging for troubleshooting.

## Configuration

CacheBolt uses a TOML file for configuration. Below is a sample configuration file:

```toml
[server]
port = 8080

[cache]
enabled = true
ttl = 3600  # Time to live in seconds

[backend]
type = "redis"
host = "localhost"
port = 6379
```

### Configuration Sections

- **server**: Configure server settings, including the port.
- **cache**: Enable or disable caching and set the time-to-live (TTL) for cached responses.
- **backend**: Define the type and connection details for your backend storage.

## API Reference

CacheBolt exposes a RESTful API for managing cache and backend settings. Below are some key endpoints:

### Get Cache Status

```
GET /api/cache/status
```

Returns the current status of the cache.

### Clear Cache

```
POST /api/cache/clear
```

Clears the entire cache.

### Backend Status

```
GET /api/backend/status
```

Checks the health of the configured backend.
